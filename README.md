# Insurance-premium-prediction
## Discription:-
This project is aimed at predicting insurane prices using machine learning techniques.By analyzing data of insurances with relevent factors such as age,gender,bmi,smoking status,region etc.The goal is to build predictive model thatcan accurately estimate prices for new customers.

## Problem statement
The goal of this project to give people an estimate of how much they need based on their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health insurance carrier and its plans and perks whilwe keeping the projected cost from our study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an insurance policy rather than the ineffective part.

## Approach
Applying machine learing tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and model testing to build a solution that should able to predict the premium of the personal for health insurance.

Data Exploration : Exploring the dataset using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Exploratory Data Analysis : Plotted different graphs to get more insights about dependent and independent variables/features.
Feature Engineering : Numerical features scaled down and Categorical features encoded.
Model Building : In this step, first dataset Splitting is done. After that model is trained on different Machine Learning Algorithms such as Linear Regression.
